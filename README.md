This package contains the jupyter notebooks for the "Crop yield forecasting" exercise held at the `ESA Land Training Course 2025 <https://landtraining2025.esa.int/>`_.

This package will be run on the Copernicus Dataspace Ecosystem (CDSE) JupyterLab.

If you wish to run the notebooks locally, see the 'Local installation' section below.

Exercise Crop yield forecasting

**Note**: *It can take a few minutes to open notebooks on JupyterLab. If jupyter-lab does not open in your browser after e.g. 5-10 minutes, refresh the JupyterLab loading page and try again.*

Jupyter notebook controls
-------------------------
If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, there are numerous tutorials available online, e.g. `here <https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/>`_ or `here <https://jupyter-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-steps/create-notebook.html>`_. Some cells in the notebooks depend on running previous cells first (otherwise you will see an error message). Therefore it is recommended to either run all cells directly (click ðŸž‚ðŸž‚) or running individual cells from top to bottom (â–º).

- **â–º** Run all code in a single block (cell)
- **â– ** Interrupt the kernel to stop any code execution
- **âŸ³** Restart the kernel
- **ðŸž‚ðŸž‚** Restart Kernel and run all cells

Data used in the tutorials needs to be downloaded from (folder /data) https://cloud.geo.tuwien.ac.at/s/YCZsYfqcLopKz33

Local installation
------------------
To run the notebooks locally, you need to clone the repository first (from the fork belonging to USER) and save the data folder downloaded above to the same directory:

`git clone https://github.com/pbueechi/ESA_LTC2025.git`

and install the requirements using
pip install -r requirements.txt
